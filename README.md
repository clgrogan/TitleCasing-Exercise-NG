# TitleCasePipe

## Exercise 3

### The application takes the user input and converts it to title case\*

Exercise to create a component takes the user input and converts it to title case \*.

\*A string is considered to be in title case if each word in the string is
either capitalized with only the first letter in uppercase. Except in the
case of a minor word, which will be all lower case unless it is the first
word of the string, in which case it will be capitalized like a 'normal'
word.

### Action Plan:

    ✔ Create Project using NG CLI
    ✔ Connect and push to GitHub
    ✔ Create Component using NG CLI
    ✔ Add exceptions/minor words table to the component
    ✔ Add the input field and titlecase output field to template
    ✔ Create a custom pipe that takes the user input and optionally a an array of minor words, then outputs the input string in titlecase.
